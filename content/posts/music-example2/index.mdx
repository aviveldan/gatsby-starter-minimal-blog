## Coding from scratch
I wanted to create my own blog for a long time.
I just wanted to put my ideas somewhere.
While coding a website from scratch is fine, inventing the wheel can be time consuming.

## GPT help
I asked Microsoft Copilot in Edge the following:
```
```
And it suggested me to use:
1. Hugo
2. Jekyll
3. Gatsby

I used Gatsby because it had some great project templates, and it supported working in React.

I then chose from their template gallery a minimal blog template._createMdxContent
This way, the blog will be customizable and I will be able to add fancy react components by my own.

Then I just:
1. Installed Gatsby with the minimal blog template
2. Started writing some posts.

Now the code is running nicely in http://localhost:8000/

But I want this blog to be reached by typing http://www.aviveldan.net/

Therefore I decided to:
1. Buy the domain aviveldan.net
2. Deploy the code to Azure as a Static web app.

For 2 I could choose different cloud providers, small to big but I have 150$ credits in azure to spend spend so...


So now I want my day to day flow to be:
1. Write post in Markdown
2. Commit - push (no PR as I work alone)
3. Deploy to staging
4. If all looks good, no typos - deploy to prod.

Additional requirements-
1. Easily generate facebook, linkedin, instagram posts that will share my work, depending on what I prefer.
2. Users will be able to contact me regarding some post using email/facebook/linkedin easily
